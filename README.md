# ML-classification-task
*Classical Iris flowers classification task solving by ML algorhitms.*

The task was completed using the tutorial from [Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/).
It helps to implement the knowledge and skills of working with Machine Learning algorithms on a concrete complete example.

### Practical skills:
* loading dataset
* primary data analysis
* data visualisation
* suitable ML alghoritms selection
* model cross-validation and choosing the best model for the current task
* make predictions
* evaluate predictions

### Theoretical knowledge:
* statistical parameters: mean, standard deviation, min, max, percentiles of the features;
* data visualisation methods: box and whisker plots, skatter matrix plots;
* K-fold cross-validation method;
* predictions evaluating parameters: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, support.

### Python libraries used:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

### Some ML algorithms appropriate for the classification task:
* Logistic Regression (LR)
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
* Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
